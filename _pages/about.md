I am Euge Stumm [(pronouns: they/them/elle/elu)](https://studentaffairs.howard.edu/diversity-inclusion/lgbtq-resources/pronouns), a Ph.D. student in Literary, Cultural, and Linguistic studies at the University of Miami. My research investigates how gender and sexual dissidents in Latin America construct language to encompass their experiences, focusing on cultural productions in non-binary Spanish in Argentina and Pajub치 in Brazil. Currently, I am working on the Digital Humanities project "[Pajub치 Digital Archive](https://eugestumm.github.io/PajubaDigitalArchive/)," which catalogs productions on and in the Brazilian cryptolect Pajub치 (or Bajub치).

I regularly update this website with all my [publications](https://eugestumm.github.io/publications/), [projects](https://eugestumm.github.io/projects/), [conference presentations](https://eugestumm.github.io/talks/), and my [curriculum vitae](https://eugestumm.github.io/assets/cv_euge_stumm.pdf).
