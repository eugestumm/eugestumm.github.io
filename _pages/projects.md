## [Transylvania Witch](https://transylvania-witch.tumblr.com/)

**Year**: 2021; **Type**: Installation

Online installation to be played in a loop. The website plays a spell that claims transforming you into a transgender woman. The installation consists of putting it in a public space and observing people’s reaction to the spell. If any of them become a transgender woman, please tell me!

## [Non-binary in Binary](https://non-binary-in-binary.tumblr.com/)

**Year**: 2021; **Type**: Installation

Online installation to be displayed in a loop. The website shows a number of non-binary identities (xenogender, mtx, demiboy, etc) converted into binary code. My goal is to reflect how non-binary gender identities cannot be understood in binary logics. This project was exhibited in the Museum of Contemporary Art of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

**Technologies**: HTML and Javascript
