## Ongoing

### [Sexual violence in video game social media: a sentiment analysis of rape speech in a subreddit of Crusader Kings (This link leads to another page)]

This is my project on Crusader Kings and sexual violence. My goal is to analyze how the community of players of the video game series Crusader Kings dealed with rape speech in their biggest Reddit community. I used the data collected from PRAW Reddit API with sentiment analysis using VADER sentiment analysis tool and descriptive and exploratory statistics to visualize and interpret the data. 


## Finished

### [Transylvania Witch](https://transylvania-witch.tumblr.com/)
Online installation to be played in a loop. The website plays a spell that claims transforming you into a transgender woman. The installation consists of putting it in a public space and observing people's reaction to the spell. If any of them become a transgender woman, please tell me!

### [Non-binary in binary](https://non-binary-in-binary.tumblr.com/)
Online installation to be displayed in a loop. The website shows a number of non-binary identities (xenogender, mtx, demiboy, etc) converted into binary code. My goal is to reflect how non-binary gender identities cannot be understood in binary logics. [This project was exhibited in the Museum of Contemporary Art of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.](https://cultura.rs.gov.br/instituto-estadual-de-artes-visuais-apresenta-a-exposicao-re-pulsa/)

### [Romaozev](https://poieticalab.itch.io/romaozev)
Digital game and installation. The game simulates labyrinth where the player cannot see the center of the screen, only the edges. The goal is to find the word love, that can only be seen with the sides of the eyes. My goal is to reflect on the lives that can only experience love through the side of their eyes.
